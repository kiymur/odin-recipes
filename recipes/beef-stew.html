    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is a hearty beef stew originally authored by Holly Nilsson. 
            This stew is perfect for the fall and winter months and is sure to help fight off a cold. 
            This recipe can be served on it's own but also pairs well with bread or biscuits.
            It is also possible to freeze the stew in advance as meal prep.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs stewing beef</li>
        <li>3 tbsp AP flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, <em>chopped</em></li>
        <li>6 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red wine, <em>optional</em></li>
        <li>1 lb potatoes, <em>peeled and cubed</em></li>
        <li>4 carrots, <em>cut into 1 inch pieces</em></li>
        <li>4 ribs celery, <em>cut into 1 inch pieces</em></li>
        <li>3 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried rosemary, <em>or 1 sprig fresh</em></li>
        <li>2 tbsp cornstarch, <em>or as needed</em></li>
        <li>2 tbsp water, <em>or as needed</em></li>
        <li>3/4 cup peas</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss beef in flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Shake off excess flour from the beef and brown it in small batches, then set aside in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the onions to the pot, adding more oil as needed, and cool until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add beef broth and red wine while scrapping up any brown bits in the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir in browned beef, potatoes, carrots, celery, tomato paste, and rosemary. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 hour or until beef is tender (up to 90 minutes).</li>
        <li>Mix equal parts cornstarch and water and create a slurry. Slowly add the slurry to the boiling stew to reach desired consistency (you may not need all of the slurry, if you'd like a thicker stew, you can add extra).</li>
        <li>Stir in peas and simmer 5-10 minutes before serving. Season with salt & pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
