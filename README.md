In this project I am going to be building a basic recipe website.

This website wil contain a main index page with links to a few recipes.

The purpose of this project is to start getting comfortable with html and using the knowledge that I've acquired in the previous lessons of The Odin Project. These skills include presenting links, images, lists, and different bodies of text with the appropriate headings and text types (ex. strong, emphasis, italics, bold, headings, etc.).
